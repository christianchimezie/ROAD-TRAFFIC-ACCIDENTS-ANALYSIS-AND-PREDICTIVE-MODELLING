# ROAD-TRAFFIC-ACCIDENTS-ANALYSIS-AND-PREDICTIVE-MODELLING
This study analyzes fatal road traffic accidents in Great Britain in 2020. The objective is to uncover accident patterns, identify factors impacting severity, and develop a model to predict fatalities. The aim is to assist the government in improving traffic safety policies and reducing accident-related fatality rates.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
The following are the top 5 suggestions that can be made to government agencies to increase
road safety based on the examination of the accident statistics for 2020:
1. Targeted Safety Measures during Rush Hours: Implement focused safety campaigns and
measures during late afternoon rush hours, as this period exhibits higher accident rates.
Enhanced law enforcement, improved signage, and public education initiatives can promote safer
driving behaviors.
2. Friday-Focused Safety Programs: Concentrate safety programs and interventions on Fridays,
considering their elevated accident rates compared to other weekdays. Implement traffic safety
initiatives, awareness campaigns, and stricter enforcement strategies. Address the Wednesday
peak through specific measures.
3. Customized Motorcycle Safety Programs: Tailor motorcycle safety initiatives based on engine
size categories and their respective peak accident times. Offer safety precautions for motorcycles
with engines of different capacities during the hours when accidents are most likely to occur.
4. Pedestrian Safety Enhancements in Late Afternoon: Strengthen pedestrian safety measures
during the late afternoon and early evening when pedestrian incidents are most frequent.
Enhance pedestrian crossings, introduce traffic calming measures, and raise awareness to
improve pedestrian safety.
5. Conduct Junction-specific Safety Audits: Regularly assess the safety of existing junctions
through safety audits. Collaborate with urban planners, traffic engineers, and safety experts to
identify potential improvements and implement changes based on the audit findings.
6. Regular Model Testing and Enhancement: Continuously test and refine the classification
model comprising Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Stacking Classifier.
Regularly update the model with new data, fine-tune its parameters, and consider incorporating
new features to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
By implementing these recommendations, government agencies can effectively enhance road
safety, reduce accident rates, and mitigate the severity of injuries in road traffic incidents.
